SAS Learning Journey
Overview
Welcome to my SAS Learning Journey repository! This repository is a personal project to document my progress, notes, and resources as I learn SAS. Here, I’ll share code examples, projects, and key concepts that I’ve covered, with the goal of building a comprehensive reference for myself and others who may find it helpful.

Goals:
Develop foundational skills in SAS programming
Explore SAS procedures and data management techniques
Practice data visualization, statistical analysis, and data manipulation in SAS
Record progress and reflections on key learning points
Repository Structure
Code: Contains SAS scripts and code files for various exercises and projects.
